title: Macbook Air smells like
---

Nah, I know, [its pretty](http://www.apple.com/macbookair/) . But has
anyone else noticed that they are switching back to [<span

class="caps">IDE</span></span>](http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?p=4762051)
? I thought that everything was going to <span class="caps"><span
class="caps">SATA</span></span>. I guess after reading up that it
doesn’t make much difference, but, whatever.

Ok, so I’m upset because I wanted a new laptop, and they didn’t come out
with one I want. Guess I’ll have to wait for the Macbook Pro updates.
