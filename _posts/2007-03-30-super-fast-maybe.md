title: super fast? maybe?
---

So I started playing with my new slice over at slicehost today, and I
got two apps running on it and it was <span class="caps"><span
class="caps">SCREAMIN</span></span> fast, then i added jonmagic.com,
configured mongrels and nginx, and things seem to have slowed <span
class="caps"><span class="caps">WAY</span></span> down! What is up with
that :-(

anyways, i’m gonna keep working on it, let me know what you think…
