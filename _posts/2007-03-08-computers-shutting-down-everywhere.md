title: Computers shutting down everywhere
---

I’ve got 6 computers, in 2 states, across 4 clients, all shutting down
or restarting randomly… This started happing about 3 weeks ago. There
are no similarities between these machines, some I built, some our from
other local computer places. None of them have the same mobo or
processor… The only thing linking them is they are all running Windows
XP.

I guess this is a cry for help, anyone experiencing the same thing?
