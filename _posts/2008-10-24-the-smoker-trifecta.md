title: the Smoker Trifecta
---

Two weekends ago Natalie bought us a smoker (for smoking meat you
silly). This weekend I will complete the trifecta of smoking. The first
weekend we smoked pork using [this
recipe](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/pulled-pork-recipe/index.html)
in order to make pulled pork sandwiches, last weekend we smoked a
chicken using [this
recipe](http://getyourgrillon.net/2008/04/21/bite-through-smoked-chicken-skin/)
and it was amazing, and this weekend I will complete the trifecta by
smoking a beef brisket using [this
recipe](http://www.thesmokerking.com/page1a.html) (please see the
[rub](http://www.thesmokerking.com/beefrub.html) and
[mop](http://www.thesmokerking.com/page7b.html) as well) from the smoker
king himself.

I know, I know, I haven’t done ribs yet. But I will have done pork,
chicken, and beef, so I believe we’ll meet the dictionary description of
a trifecta:

“a run of three wins or grand events”

Time to start smoking!
