title: How Yahoo ticked off my/its clients...
---

Yahoo messed up. In introducing their new Yahoo Webmail Beta, they
blocked all <span class="caps"><span class="caps">POP</span></span> and
<span class="caps"><span class="caps">SMTP</span></span> access (a.k.a.
people using Outlook or other mail clients) to their mail services,
until you login via webmail and click thru two screens. This has
affected all of their business service clients, dsl clients using pop
access, and people who have upgraded their free Yahoo accounts to
Premium accounts by paying a small yearly fee.
