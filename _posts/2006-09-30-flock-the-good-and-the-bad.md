title: flock, the good and the bad
---

Well, I’ve got mixed feelings about [flock](http://www.flock.com/) right
now. Despite the negatives I’m about list, you should definitely try it
out if you can…

**Positives:**\

1.  It just seems snappier on my 867mhz powerbook than firefox. I wonder
    if they’ve optimized it at all? Firefox’s speed has been the one
    thing that kept me from switching all my web browsing from Safari to
    Firefox, so maybe Flock will do the trick?
2.  It looks cool, clean low profile interface, no big ugly extras
3.  It has great features, blog posting,
    [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us) favs, [flickr](http://flickr.com)
    bar, and it is based on firefox, so who nows what extensions and
    themes will come out…

**Negatives:**\

1.  limited blog support, won’t work with my typo blog **<span
    class="caps"><span class="caps">UPDATE</span></span>** I got it
    working, just had to click “Cancel” after it fails to auto detect
    your blog, and then it lets you setup stuff manually… I’m posting
    this update via Flock
2.  creating a new favorite with tags does not tag it in del.icio.us
    (this has to be a bug that they haven’t fixed yet)
3.  there was way to much hype surrounding flock, thankfully i ignored
    most of it, so i’m not disappointed too much, but it still doesn’t
    quite live up to what i thought it would be… thank goodness this is
    only a dev release i’m using :-)

**Conclusion:**\
I think this is going to be a great browser, and there is a pretty good
chance I will use it as my primary (hopefully only) web browser once it
is a little more mature… actually, i’ll use it as my primary now, at
least for a few days, and see if i can find any other nuggets hidden in
there… nuf said
