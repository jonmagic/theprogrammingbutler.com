I could sure use some of those :) I wonder if a blue tassle with a blue
cord is close enough :) No seriously, I struggle so much with my old
sinful self I wish there were something symbolic constantly in my vision
reminding me…

Actually, just having read these verses several times helps me pause
more often and question my motives and make sure I’m not prostituting
myself by the lust of my eyes and heart…

But this brings up another train of thought, if God has written the law
on my heart (still looking up these verses per another conversation) I
probably don’t need a real blue tassle, because i have little blue
tassles hanging on my heart, i.e. my conscience…

I dunno, what do you think?\
grr, i’m going to have to log into my admin interface and enable
