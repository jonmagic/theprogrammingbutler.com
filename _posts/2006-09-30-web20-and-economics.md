title: web20 and economics?
---

I’m bored… I’m working pretty hard at
[Sabretech](http://www.sabretechllc.com) , trying to bring home the
bacon, but it is just not enough…

I’ve been spending every extra free time moment reading up on and
studing this web trend called web 2.0… What is it about you ask? Mr.
O’Reilly [gets it
right](http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2005/10/web_20_compact_definition.html)
I think…

SO, I really want to contribute somehow, but I’m a nobody in the web 20
world, and honestly haven’t had many ground breaking ideas in a long
time (if ever)… But I will not be deterred, so I’ve decided to start
thinking about web20 from economic stand point, since that was my focus
in college…

That said, don’t come back here looking for amazing insights or
anything. Maybe just maybe though I’ll have an epiphany and “make it” in
the web20 movement :-)
