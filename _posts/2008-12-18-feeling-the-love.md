Wow, I must have more friends this year than ever! Several friends
called to wish me a happy birthday, I got 10 happy bday text messages,
and about 20 emails!

So anyways, thank you everyone, it was a great birthday. I actually took
the day off, the first time since before college I remember not working
or taking exams on my bday (except for that one time our prof brought us
into class for the exam, and then told us all we got an A and to have a
nice day).

This morning I went Christmas shopping for my wife and my sister. Then
this afternoon/evening I smoked a chicken out in the garage. Tina (my
lil’sis) showed up a bit after four and she chilled in the garage with
me for a couple hours. At 7pm Nat got home from work and we skyped with
mom and dad and had a mini-birthday/Christmas party. Since this was our
only chance for all of us to get together (virtually) we opened gifts
and just had a wonderful time. After that we had an amazing dinner
together and watched a movie. To top it off we had Tiramisu that Natalie
made… mmm, good

In the past I haven’t always looked forward to my birthday. From now on,
i think I will.
