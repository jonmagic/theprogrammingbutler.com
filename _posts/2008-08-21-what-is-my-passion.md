title: What is my passion?
---

I’ve had a hard time with this question lately, and it has been coming
up time and time again. I’ve been praying about, asking for guidance,
trying to figure out what I should be pouring my heart into.

While nothing really jumps out, here are a few things that I enjoy doing
and do a lot:

1.  My job, fixing people’s computers, making people happy
2.  My family, doing all the little things that make Natalie happy, even
    if she doesn’t realize it
3.  Programming, for fun, for work, for side projects

So according to [this
article](http://www.43folders.com/2008/08/19/good-blogs) I should blog
about something I’m passionate about. I guess I’ll have to redefine that
to *somethings*.
