---

I hope everyone had a wonderful Thanksgiving. I watched some football,
cooked a ham and some stuffing, and had an amazing meal with 5 friends
(one of those being my fiancee). I’m now stuffed, and despite what
[wikipedia says about
tryptophan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryptophan#Tryptophan_and_turkey)
I still believe it makes you drowsy…
