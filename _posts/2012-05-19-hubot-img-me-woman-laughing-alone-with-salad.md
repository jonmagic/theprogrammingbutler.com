In the past month I've had the opportunity to present this talk twice,
first in London England and then in Verona Italy.

Before joining GitHub I met [Zach Holman](http://zachholman.com/) from
GitHub at a conference in Colorado and heard about
[Hubot](http://hubot.github.com). As soon as Hubot was released as open
source we started using him at Ordered List and I blogged a simple
[script writing
tutorial](http://theprogrammingbutler.com/blog/archives/2011/10/28/hubot-scripts-explained/)
which is still my most popular blog post day to day.

After joining GitHub I got up the nerve to write and submit a talk
proposal and low and behold two out of three of the conferences I
submitted to accepted my talk. I gave this presentation first in London
at [DevsLoveBacon](http://devslovebacon.com/) and you can find the
[video of my talk](http://devslovebacon.com/speakers/jonathan-hoyt) on
their site. A few weeks later I traveled to [jsDay in Verona
Italy](http://2012.jsday.it/) and presented a second time!

Here are the slides from my presentation.

If you have any feedback on how I can make the talk better or any
questions about Hubot please send it via [Twitter
