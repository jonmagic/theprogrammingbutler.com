title: The longest weekend of my life
---

I don’t even know where to begin… Simply put, an onsite I started on
Friday morning turned into an all weekend marathon of Windows 2000 Small
Business Server hacking, repeated reinstalls, Mountain Dew, energy
drinks, 3 hours of sleep here, 2 there, running between 25 workstations
configuring them and cleaning them up, and a whole lot more… It is now a
little past 7pm on Sunday and I’m just praying that I can go home soon…
