title: Evolution of a twitter client
---

One of my clients wants his employees to be able to use twitter, but
there were some strict requirements involved, and I couldn’t find a
twitter client for windows that met all of those requirements, so I
decided to write my own twitter client.

I’m modeling it after Tweetie for <span class="caps"><span
class="caps">OSX</span></span> of course (in look and function). I know
ruby best, so I decided to use [\_why’s](http://whytheluckystiff.net/)
[Shoes](http://shoooes.net/) and [John Nunemakers](http://railstips.org)
[twitter gem](http://github.com/jnunemaker/twitter/tree/master).

For those interested in writing a twitter client and using shoes, or
like to see the evolution of an app, be sure to check out this article.

This article is going to be updated as I write this app, but I just
wanted to start with a slideshow of the evolution of the app so far.
