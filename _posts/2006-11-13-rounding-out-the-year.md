title: Rounding out the year
---

What a great year! Here are some of the things I thank God for
everyday:\

1.  I’m [getting married!](http://jonmagic.com/2006/8/4/i-m-engaged)
2.  Brad Cochran and I bought [SabreTech Consulting <span
    class="caps"><span
    class="caps">LLC</span></span>](http://www.sabretechllc.com) just
    over a year and a half ago, and it is just about paid off…
3.  Good health the last 6 months (with the exception of today), I even
    had my wisdom teeth removed (finally!)
4.  I’ve had the opportunity to travel, a lot
5.  [New laptop](http://jonmagic.com/2006/5/16/i-bought-one)
6.  New (used) car… 98 Malibu
7.  Healthy family! My sis is back from school now too, and that is
    always nice…

I had other ones, but just can’t remember them all right now… I’m sick
and need to take a nap so I can get better, so I’m going to lie down
now…
