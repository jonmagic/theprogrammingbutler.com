My team at SabreTech has been busy building their own personal blogs!

Sam Sallows has his new blog up at
[www.samtheslacker.com](http://www.samtheslacker.com)

and Dan Parker has had his up for awhile at
[blog.behindlogic.com](http://blog.behindlogic.com)

Sam already has an excellent bit on what we can do for clients that need
to run older windows apps that will only run on an old OS like Windows
2000 or Windows 98â€¦
