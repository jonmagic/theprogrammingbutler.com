Whiskey Glazed Pork Chops
-------------------------

-   1/2 cup Jack Danielâ€™s Tennessee whiskey
-   1/2 apple cider
-   2 tablespoons of light brown sugar
-   1 tablespoon dijon mustard
-   1/8 teaspoon of cayenne pepper
-   1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
-   4 teaspoons cider vinegar
-   4 bone-in, center-cut pork chops, about 1 inch thick
-   2 teaspoons vegetable oil
-   salt and pepper
-   1 tablespoon unsalted butter

1.  Whisk together the whiskey, cider, brown sugar, mustard, cayenne,
    vanilla, and 2 teaspoons of vinegar. Marinate the chops in a
    quarter (1/4) of this liquid, set aside the rest.
2.  Remove chops from the bag, pat dry with paper towels, and
    discard marinade. Heat up oil in a large skillet over medium-high
    heat until its just starting to smoke. Season the chops with salt
    and pepper, then throw them in the pan and brown both sides, 2-3
    minutes per side. Transfer chops to a plate and cover tightly
    with foil.
3.  Add the rest of the whiskey mix into the skillet and bring to a
    boil, scraping up any brown bits from the meat. Cook until reduced
    to a thick glaze, 3 to 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and
    drain any juices from the chops plate to the mix. Add 2 teaspoons of
    cider vinegar, whisk in the butter, and simmer until thick and
    sticky, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove pan from heat.
4.  Return chops to skillet and let them rest in the pan until sauce
    clings to them, turning to coat both sides. Leave in there while
    they finish cooking, about 5 minutes.

Country Style Tomatoes

-   8oz of cream cheese
-   1/2 teaspoon dried basil
-   1 garlic clove, minced
-   1/4 teaspoon of salt
-   flour
-   bread crumbs
-   1 egg
-   1 tablespoon of milk
-   3 tablespoons of butter
-   3 tablespoons of olive oil

1.  Cut each tomato into four thick slices, and then place on paper
    towels to drain. In a small bowl beat the cream cheese, basil,
    garlic and salt until blended. Spread mixture onto half the tomato
    slices and then top with remaining slices.
2.  Place flour and bread crumbs in separate pie pans, in another pan
    whisk egg and milk. Coat top and bottom of each tomato stack with
    flour, then egg mixture, and then bread crumbs.
3.  In a large skillet, heat butter and oil over medium-high heat. Fry
    tomato sandwiches in batches for 3-4 minutes on each side or until
    golden brown. Drain on paper towels and serve.
