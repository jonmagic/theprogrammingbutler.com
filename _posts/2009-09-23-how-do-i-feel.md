title: How do I feel?
---

This bit from Bones cracked me up tonight. Bones is asked how she’s
feeling after being attacked by a bad guy. She replies that the doctors
gave her medication, so she imagines she feels like people of average
intelligence feel all the time.

I died laughing :-)

I wish I could say that of myself right now, but unfortunately drugs
make me feel like I’m 16 again. Not really caring about higher thought,
emotional from hormones, and frustrated that I can’t seem to do anything
right.
