[Numbers
11](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2011;&version=31;)\

Notice in verse 1 about complaining in the Lord’s hearing… Doesn’t he
hear everything, which means to me, don’t <span class="caps"><span
class="caps">EVER</span></span> complain about what he has given you…\

Never compare your old life, the sinful one, to your life in Christ (see
verses 4b-6). I’m guilty of this, in many ways (I can think of one I
bring up almost everyday, but will no more after reading this)…\

Not everything you want is best for you (see verses 18-20). Doesn’t God
know what is best, He created us after all. Watch what you wish for,
because there is a chance He’ll give it to you, but it may not be what
you need after all. Pray and ask God to show you His will, so when you
wish for something, it may be what God desires for you.\
