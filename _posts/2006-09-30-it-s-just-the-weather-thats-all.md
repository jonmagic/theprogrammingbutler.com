title: It's just the weather, thats all...
---

Good morning…

Isn’t this great weather we’ve been having! Temps have been in the 50’s
and 60’s, thunderstorms have been rolling through… I love a good storm.

So I’m wrapping up a big programming project, just doing the final
touches here and there, addressing the customers final concerns, and
I’ve already started my next project. Sabretech is in dire need of a
trouble ticket system better than the one we’re using… We currently use
the ticket system module in [egroupware](http://www.egroupware.org), as
well as the egroupware calendar module. I can say we are less than
thrilled with our current situation… So I’ve started this new project
and called it Optiks, short for Opportunity Tickets. As you can see, the
first thing we’re dropping is the Trouble part :-) Dad suggested this,
hehe… I’m designing and building this with [37
Signals](http://37signals.com/) methodology in mind… Some people would
like it to have everything and the kitchen sink… I’m mostly just
interested in it doing a few simple things really well, with a nice
<span class="caps"><span class="caps">API</span></span> and the ability
to expand and change it later on… So that is what I’m doing!

Also, looks like I’ll be jamming with Roll the Dice this coming Friday
night… I played in church this morning, and then practiced this
afternoon with RtD… We didn’t sound too bad i guess :-)

Good Night…
