title: Wolfgang's Vault

This is another one of those times where I’m spurred to blog just
because i found something totally cool…

On the radio this morning I heard about Wolfgang’s Vault and
specifically the Vault Radio… The Vault Radio is an online radio station
playing live recordings from the 60’s and 70’s from concerts all over
the world by a myriad of musicians. The common theme between them all is
they were all promoted by [Bill
Graham](http://www.wolfgangsvault.com/About.aspx?Type=BillGraham.htm) …

So, please go over to [Wolfgang’s Vault](http://www.wolfgangsvault.com)
and listen to some great music :-)
