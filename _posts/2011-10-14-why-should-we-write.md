title: Why Should We Write?
---

Building a career as a programmer requires a lot of hard work,
determination, and in my opinion a lot of writing.

How do you build a personal brand online? How do you get opportunities
to work on awesome projects? How do you get invited to speak at
conferences? Looking at my coworkers success I would deduce that you
have to work hard on stuff you care about and then share the knowledge
you have gained with your peers, writing on a
[blog](http://orderedlist.com/blog/) [for](http://railstips.org/)
[example](http://opensoul.org/).

Writing has always been a struggle for me, I was always a math geek, but
I cannot use that as an excuse if I want to continually advance my
career. If we are working online, building websites, doing design,
programming web applications, or working on infrastructure, we need to
be writing about our experiences.

We run into new problems every day. More often than not the solution is
a [Google
search](http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=what+is+the+answer+to+life+the+universe+and+everything&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)
away. But when it isn’t and we find a solution on our own, we should be
writing it down and sharing it with the world.

Whether its writing [readme’s](https://github.com/jonmagic/grim#readme)
for an open source library,
[blogging](http://jonmagic.com/blog/archives/2011/10/06/grim-multiprocessor-to-the-rescue/)
about how you solved a problem, or [sharing some
insight](http://jonmagic.com/blog/archives/2011/10/03/just-write-it-down/)
about how to become a better person, I think we should all be writing
more and sharing it with the world.

Lets become better communicators thru practice, making the world a
better place while at the same time advancing our careers.
