---

Total bummer, the [osx86project.org](http://www.osx86project.org) got
shut down today… I hope they can figure this out and get back online…
major bummer dude

Awhile back (3 years ago) I wrote [a little
article](http://jonmagic.com/thegoodcritic/magazines/pcmag/johndvorak/idiot.html)
about how I thought John Dvorak was nuts… Well, I’m not going to go into
detail on why I still think he’s nuts other than to link to [his latest
article](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,1927885,00.asp) and say,
<span class="caps"><span class="caps">JOHN</span> <span
class="caps">YOU</span> <span class="caps">ARE</span> <span
class="caps">NUTS</span></span>!

But hey, I still enjoy listening to you on [<span class="caps"><span
class="caps">TWIT</span></span>](http://www.thisweekintech.com)
