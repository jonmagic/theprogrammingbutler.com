title: Configuring PBX in a Flash to use Rhino cards
---

If you are using a [Rhino Equipment
card](http://www.rhinoequipment.com/) as your pstn or digital interface
to the telco, and need help setting it up on your asterisk based <span
class="caps"><span class="caps">PBX</span></span>, look no further!

[This google doc](http://docs.google.com/View?id=atnp7jn5zpr_95fn6n8bc6)
has just the instructions you need. (thanks to James at Rhino for these
great instructions!)

Also, as far as telco cards go, I couldn’t recommend anyone better than
[Rhino](http://www.rhinoequipment.com/). Their cards are great, and
their technical support is the best I’ve ever had from any company,
<span class="caps"><span class="caps">EVER</span></span>. They are,
simply put, amazing at what they do.

Oh yeah, when it comes to open source <span class="caps"><span
class="caps">PBX</span></span> platforms, [<span class="caps"><span
class="caps">PBX</span></span> in a Flash](http://www.pbxinaflash.com/)
is the best I’ve found. I’ve tried Asterisk@Home, Trixbox, and a couple
others. PiaF is easy to setup, clean, and simple.
