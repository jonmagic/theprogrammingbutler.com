I’m not really into halloween, but it is a good excuse to dress up :-)

I was going to be one of the dudes from the movie Hackers (preferably
Dade, aka zero cool, aka crash override), but while looking at some
shirts on [Jinx](http://www.jinx.com/) I found [this
tshirt](http://www.jinx.com/scripts/details.asp?affid=-1&productID=269)
and it gave me an entirely new idea… I’m going to be Arthur Dent from
Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy… And what might [he look
like](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/graphics/2005/04/15/fthitch115.jpg)
you ask?

Answer: A lot like
[this](http://www.wanadoo.co.uk/images/editorial/generalarticle/entertainment/Films/film05/hitchhikers_bvi-170.jpg)

So, that is that… nuf said
