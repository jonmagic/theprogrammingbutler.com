title: Juiced Up

Just posted a bunch of recipes I had written out on paper on our fridge
to [forkinit](http://forkinit.com/jonmagic/recipes/). Here they are:

-   [Sweet & sour
    mix](http://forkinit.com/jonmagic/recipes/fresh-sweet-sour/)
-   [Silver
    Grapefruit](http://forkinit.com/jonmagic/recipes/silver-grapefruit/)
-   [Grapefruit
    Juiced](http://forkinit.com/jonmagic/recipes/grapefruit-juiced/)

I’ve gotten into the habit of making fresh juice when I need it around
the house. Grapefruits are pretty cheap (oranges <span
class="caps">ARE</span> <span class="caps">NOT</span>), and lemons and
limes can be had for a pretty good deal if you look around a bit.
