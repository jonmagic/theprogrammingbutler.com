I guess its time for a new car… or do i keep pouring money into my
current one? The never ending question…

I went to leave hdale for home at about 12:30am tonight… Just got done
watching Mission Impossible at Natalie’s and was excited to sleep in my
bed. I made it to the end of the block before giving up and parking in a
college lot… The whole van after i left the driveway was shaking, i
thought it was just some extra ratelage from the muffler that fell off
this weekend… Well, i couldn’t even get up to 30mph without practically
losing my dentures (and i don’t even have dentures yet!)…

I hope they don’t tow the van tonight ;-)

**Update:**

I just realized how blessed i am… i’ve been all moany and groany and
feeling sorry for myself since my van died last night… and then i
realized that all this could have happened while i was on vacation this
weekend! Not only did I make it home safe, but i broke down not far from
my office (and even closer to Natalie’s)…

Anyways, I’m thanking God and praying that He will guide me in what new
vehicle to get… I’ve found to that i’m super interested in, a 97 escort
sport and a 91 honda civic si… the escort appears to be a better deal,
but we shall see…
