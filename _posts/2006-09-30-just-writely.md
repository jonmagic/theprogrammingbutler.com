use ms word, or even open office, if you can do stuff like this! <span

[<span class="caps"><span class="caps">CHECK</span> <span
class="caps">OUT</span></span> writely <span class="caps">AS <span
class="caps">SOON</span> AS <span
class="caps">POSSIBLE</span></span>](http://www.writely.com "CHECK OUT writely AS SOON AS POSSIBLE")…\

<span class="caps"><span class="caps">UPDATE</span></span>: I had a
problem posting a document from writely to my blog (the first part of
this post to be exact), and there was a feedback button in the writely
webapp, so i went ahead and gave some feedback on what i was trying to
do and what the error was, and within ten minutes one of the app
designers / programmers had e-mailed me… so i emailed back and ended up
setting up a typo blog for him to test with… sweet action, i hope he
gets it working…
