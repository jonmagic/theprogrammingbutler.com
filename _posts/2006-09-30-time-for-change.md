title: Time for change
---

I’ve been meaning to redo my site for quite some time now…
[blosxom](http://www.blosxom.com) was great, but with time come changes.
So I’ve switched to using [Typo](http://typo.leetsoft.com) for my
blogging engine… It was built using
[RubyOnRails](http://www.rubyonrails.com) , a new web development
framework that is pretty nifty…

**What does this mean for you?** Not much really, a new look and feel…
My old site is still there with all the old content, just use the links
on the right to access it… I considered importing all my old posts to
the new system, but decided I don’t have enough time.

**What does this mean for me?** Again, not much. Its going to be easier
to post now, and I can enhance my site using quite a bit more as I have
time… Any new feature I want I can implement, whether someone else has
done it or not… Hopefully this will get me excited about blogging again,
so you my poor reader(s) do not get bored :-)
