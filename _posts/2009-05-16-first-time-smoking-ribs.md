title: First time smoking ribs
---

Nat and I smoked pork spare ribs over this Memorial weekend, and they
were so yummy.

Here is a picture of the rub we made, definitely too intense we found
out. We will put together a much simpler one next time. We put the rub
on them the night before.

[See the recipe here](http://bit.ly/v02eI).

We smoked the ribs for about 5 hours at 205 to 225 degrees Fahrenheit in
my vertical water smoker.

Here was my smoker setup.

After smoking I wrapped them in foil, then wrapped in a warm wet towel,
and threw in a cooler for an hour to rest. Finally we threw them on the
grill for 2 to 4 minutes, some with just the dry rub they’d marinated
and smoked in, and the rest I threw some store bought bbq sauce on.

Natalie made baked beans and potato salad, so we had quite a feast :-)

**<span class="caps"><span class="caps">NOTE</span></span>:** Things
we’ll do differently next time:

-   simpler rub, and less of it
-   3-2-1 method of cooking, [see
    here](http://www.wyntk.us/food/3-2-1-rib-method.shtml)
-   home made bbq sauce
