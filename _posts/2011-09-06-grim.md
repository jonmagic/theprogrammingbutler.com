Grim is a simple gem for extracting (reaping) a page from a pdf and
converting it to an image as well as extract the text from the page as a
string.

[Grim](https://github.com/jonmagic/grim) is my first Ruby gem! Not
technically my first <span class="caps">OSS</span> contribution, but
definitely my first gem. This project came out of [Speaker
Deck](http://speakerdeck.com) and is used by Speaker Deck whenever you
upload a presentation.

### Sample usage

```ruby
pdf = Grim.reap("/path/to/pdf")
count = pdf.count
pdf[3].save('/path/to/image.png')
text = pdf[3].text

pdf.each do |page|
  puts page.text
end
```

This gem is perfect for anyone working with PDFâ€™s that wants to extract
single pages as images or the text from a page using Ruby.

Enjoy!
