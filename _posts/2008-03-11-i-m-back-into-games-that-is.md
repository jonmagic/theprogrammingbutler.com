title: I'm back! into games that is
---

Ok, so thats not quite true, I did play some Counter-Strike and stuff
last year, but last night and today I really got back into gaming.

What better way to get back into things than play
[Portal](http://orange.half-life2.com/portal.html) by Valve… Part of the
[Orange Box](http://orange.half-life2.com/index.html) this game is a
strategy game from a first person perspective, and it was fantastic… I
don’t know if I’ve ever enjoyed a game that much. The story was simple
but interesting, the narrator/boss was hilarious, and it had the best
game ending I’ve ever seen (I kinda knew how good the ending was before
I played it though cuz of Jonathan Coultan’s jump into fame).

Anyways, I guess Wednesday Xian is going to get me into Team Fortress 2
which he plays a lot and speaks very highly of…
