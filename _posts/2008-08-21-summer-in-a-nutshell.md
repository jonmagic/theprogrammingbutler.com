title: Summer in a nutshell
---

Last year I got married. Natalie and I had bought a house in Elkhart
Indiana, and we moved there the same week we married and have been
making a home here since then. My memory is so bad I can’t remember what
we did last fall, winter, or spring, but I do remember most of this
summer :-)

Natalie started a new job this summer and is loving it. Late spring I
picked up a bad habit, gaming, and it has stuck with me thru the summer.
More notable is our vacation in June, where my brother in-law and sister
in-law came up to stay with us, and we rocked Elkhart <span

But the most important thing that happened this summer in our lives,
wasn’t even something that happened directly to us. My parents finally
got all their support (to become missionaries), spent a couple months
getting ready, and flew to Argentina to start new lives as church
planters (these events did not necessarily happen in that order). This
has affected us though, now neither Natalie nor I have parents close by.
The closest immediate relative is my sister, an hour away.

As summer closes up we reflect. It was a good summer, full of life
changes, some surprises, many blessings, and a few hard times.
