title: Today I mowed the lawn
---

My lawn that is :-) I own property now, I have a lawn! Weird…

So, woke up late (I’m on my honeymoon still), went out for breakfast
with Natalie, and then got around to mowing my lawn finally… <span
class="caps"><span class="caps">THE</span> <span
class="caps">WHOLE</span> <span class="caps">THING</span></span>,
including the mini jungle I had going on the south side of the property…
Every row in the back yard had to be run over 2 times (at least, in some
cases 3 or 4) and it took over three hours! Three hours to mow a little
lawn! Thats not even including weed wacking, cuz I don’t have a weed
wacker yet… With all the edges, trees, shrubs, etc on this property I
imagine it could take even longer to do the weed wacking…

Anyways, being domesticated is interesting. Being married is even more
interesting. Good times :-)
