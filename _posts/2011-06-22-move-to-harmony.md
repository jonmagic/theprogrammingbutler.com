title: Move to Harmony
---

If you use the older Mephisto blogging app for your website and need
something to replace it that \_just works\_, check out
"Harmony":http://get.harmonyapp.com.

[Harmony](http://get.harmonyapp.com) is a website management system that
I get to hack on for my day job at [Ordered
List](http://orderedlist.com). Recently some sites I had built at my
previous job using Mephisto, a Rails blogging app, went down after
[Site5](http://site5.com) moved them to a new server and broke
Mephisto’s dependencies.

The only reason I’m writing this post is because I moved one of those
sites over to Harmony in three hours flat last night, improving the site
structure along the way and making it super easy for the client to
change it in any way they want.

I’m totally plugging my employer and our product here, but I’m serious
when I say Harmony rocks. Setting up the websites structure, splitting
out the content into easily manageable sections, adding image upload
fields where needed (for bio’s for example), customizing field types for
services versus products, the list goes on.

So, if your site is on Mephisto and its either dead or dying, or you
want to start using something that *just works* for building websites,
give [Harmony](http://get.harmonyapp.com) a spin!
