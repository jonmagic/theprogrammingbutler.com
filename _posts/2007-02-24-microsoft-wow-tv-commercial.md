title: Microsoft Wow TV Commercial
---

Ok, so I just watched a commercial and it was really really cool. It
showed different scenes with people doing cool things, a family from the
60’s watching one of the Apollo missions blast off, a fairly old
gentleman blowing out candles at his birthday party, a young girl
hitting a golf ball across a pond, just to name a few. At the end of
each scene someone in the scene would say Wow, like they were really
effected by whatever was happening. It was a feel good commercial.

But then it switches to a guy opening a laptop, and I thought it was a
laptop commercial, until it popped up Vista’s new application/window
switching (a la Alt-Tab, now Windows-Tab).

**Windows Vista**

and all I could think was

#### Wow

see it for yourself
