title: Temperature Time
---

Ok, so last weekend I totally botched the brisket. It was slightly
edible, more like a steak than anything I guess, but a really really
tough steak. So, rather than give up I’m getting right back on that
horse till I can ride thru to the end.

But, being like my father, I’m not going to settle for mediocre tools.
My smoker only came with a simple thermometer in it that says, Warm –
Ideal – Hot, with no temperatures in degrees on it. I could have just
gone and bought an \$8 oven thermometer and attached it, but I thought
I’d get something a bit cooler and take my time installing it :-)

Its easiest to tell this story with pictures, so here goes. This first
pic is the Brinkman el-cheapo smoker pre-mods.\

Next up is are the tools and parts I used (minus the bandsaw).\

Here is the chunk-o-wood I cut with the bandsaw.\

Next I clamped on my chunk of wood and drilled holes for my bolts, then
I bolted it on, and finally drilled a couple holes for the thermometer
probe.\

I inserted the Maverick wireless thermometer probe and put on the
grate.\

Here is a pic from another angle without the grate on.\

And last but not least here it is with everything installed and the
transmitter and receiver running.\

Hopefully tomorrow night I’ll be able to blog a good report about my
next brisket. This one is 4 pounds and purchased from a local butcher
rather than from the grocery store. Here’s to hoping!
