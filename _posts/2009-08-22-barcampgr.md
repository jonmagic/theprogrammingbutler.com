Just wanted to post a little something while I’m still here at
[BarCampGR](http://barcampgr.org/), an attendee driven conference. Its
been great fun, as you can see from the many [posts to
twitter](http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23barcampgr)…

### Note to those who attended my talk on smoking meats, here are some great links:

-   [Amazing Ribs](http://amazingribs.com) is the definitive place to
    learn about smoking ribs. Look at the page about Texas Crutch to
    find the perfect cooking method.
-   [this chicken
    recipe](http://getyourgrillon.net/2008/04/21/bite-through-smoked-chicken-skin/)
    is amazing, just make sure you cut down the salt they use in the
    brine, <span class="caps"><span class="caps">AND</span></span> the
    rub, by half, or it will be way too salty.
-   kind of off topic, but [this was a great
    recipe](http://gist.github.com/129533), even if it had nothing to do
    with smoking :-)
-   wanna see my original rig? [check it
    out](http://jonmagic.com/2008/11/1/temperature-time)

Subscribe to my [rss feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/jonmagic), or at
least follow me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/jonmagic), if you are
interested in smoking, or cooking in general. Oh yeah, I post about tech
too.
