title: Obsession and Understanding
---

I've been emotionally up and down a lot the past few months and a lot of
it has had to do with work. Don't get me wrong, I love my job, and
therein lies the problem.

I’ve always been very passionate about my work, but as I get older and
learn more about life, I’m realizing I need to put things into better
perspective.

Obsessing about one area of your life is unhealthy. Religion, politics,
work, hobbies, or family; obsessing over any of these can lead to
anxiety, stress, and dissatisfaction with life.

God has been teaching me lately that I need to put my hope in Him, that
I need to understand my joy will never come directly from any of those
areas of life I mentioned above, but that it can come from recognizing
His work in my life in all of those arena’s.

Right now I need to stop obsessing on what I want out of my job, and
start understanding how I’m learning and growing in my job.
