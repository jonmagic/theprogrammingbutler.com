[Bill Cosby](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Cosby), one of the
greatest comedians of all time (and the cleanest) was on Leno tonight,
and after seeing him Natalie and I watched a few of his older bits on
YouTube. I’d forgotten how absolutely hilarious he was and how timeless
his comedy is. I thought I’d share a few clips with you that we really
liked.

### Natalie remembered this one from when she was a kid.

### This one would have been good about 8 years ago,

### and this one about 9 years ago.

### This one of course is excellent.

### To finish off this series Natalie picked this one.
