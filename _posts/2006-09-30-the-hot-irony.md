title: The hot irony...
---

Leading up to the arrival of my Macbook today I’ve been reading every
single thing I could find about it on the internet, and was somewhat
scared of all the reviews that talked about the crazy heat that it puts
out…

Well, I’m happy to say mine runs great, hot but great… But the irony is,
with my [non
laptop](http://www.engadget.com/2006/05/19/warning-from-apple-dont-put-our-laptops-on-your-lap/)
on my lap it doesn’t bother me at all… It is hot, but its hot on my bad
leg (my left leg has very little sensation due to an accident years
ago)…

Apple, how did you know :-)
