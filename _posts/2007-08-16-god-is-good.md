title: God is good
---

So Natalie started job hunting monday. She got her resume fixed up and
started dropping it off at places and filling out applications, etc… By
the end of Tuesday she had applied for 20 different jobs. Wednesday she
hung out with me all day and didn’t do much of anything about job
hunting. This morning Seiffert’s Drug in downtown Elkhart called and
asked her to come in for an interview at 2pm. The interview went well
and at 5pm they called and offered her the job, which she took!

Wow, she starts tomorrow. It just amazes me how great God is. She was
only out of work for the two weeks of vacation we each took for getting
married and our honeymoon. In fact, this friday (tomorrow) was her last
paycheck from krogers because of vacation pay. So in essence she will
have had a steady income for the last 4+ years, without missing a single
paycheck, and all that having moved states and switched employers.
