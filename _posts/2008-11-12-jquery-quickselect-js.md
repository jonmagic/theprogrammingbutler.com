Thanks to [Daniel](http://behindlogic.com) for creating a [nifty new
jquery](http://github.com/dcparker/jquery_plugins/tree/master/quickselect)
plugin for me!
[Quickselect](http://github.com/dcparker/jquery_plugins/tree/master/quickselect)
takes select/option tags in html and turns them into an input box with
live search, and can even use the
[quicksilver.js](http://rails-oceania.googlecode.com/svn/lachiecox/qs_score/trunk/qs_score.js)
for more interesting search results.

I needed this for Suite, the software I’m writing to manage my company
[SabreTech](http://www.sabretechllc.com) and I could not for the life of
me find a jquery plugin that did something nifty like this. I had found
this
[autocomplete](http://www.pengoworks.com/workshop/jquery/autocomplete.htm)
plugin, and [this live search](http://ejohn.org/blog/jquery-livesearch/)
plugin (which was actually a rewrite of another plugin by a friend of
mine, [John
Nunemaker](http://orderedlist.com/articles/live-search-with-quicksilver-style-for-jquery)
)…

So I asked Dan to write this up for us yesterday, and this afternoon he
found some time and put it together, and guess what, it works <span
class="caps"><span class="caps">PERFECTLY</span></span>!

Well, I hope others find this useful…
