Ever since [Hubot](http://hubot.github.com) was released I've been
regular expressing myself. Here is a tool I built to make testing
regular expressions in javascript easier.

[Rubular](http://rubular.com) was my go to for testing regex in the
past, but its targeted at Ruby so I went in search of a nice editor for
javascript regular expressions. Unfortunately my search yielded no
results. Fortunately I had the tools and experience to build one!

[Scriptular](http://scriptular.com) is the fruits of my labor. I modeled
Scriptular after Rubular with one major difference. It doesnâ€™t have a
backend service, everything runs in the browser.

I am really excited about Scriptular, I think it will be useful for
developers everywhere. With its current implementation you can test how
a regex reacts in any browser by loading Scriptular in that browser and
testing the regex. In the future I would also like to have a backend
service for testing server side javascript implementations like V8.

So go [kick the tires](http://scriptular.com), give it a [spin around
the block](http://scriptular.com), and let me know what you think. If
you would like to help on the project please [check it out on
GitHub](http://github.com/jonmagic/scriptular).

Update: Thanks to [@bkeepers](http://opensoul.org) for contributing the
design.
