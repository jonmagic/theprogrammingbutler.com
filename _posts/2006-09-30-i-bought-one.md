Actually, my business bought one for me, but still… What am I talking
about?

**I bought a [Macbook](http://www.apple.com/macbook/) this afternoon!**

Ok, so I don’t have it yet (hopefully monday) but i have been looking at
macbook pictures and have been reading about it as much as possible
(including a firsthand report from xian)… So here are some links you can
check out if you are interested…
