[Writely](http://www.writely.com "Writely") I tried their brand new
blogging feature out and it didn’t work all so well with
[Typo](http://typo.leetsoft.com "Typo") . So I did the little “report a
bug” thing on [Writely](http://www.writely.com "Writely") and it wasn’t
even 10 minutes before I got an e-mail from Sam@Writely (very cool guy)
asking if I could setup a [Typo](http://typo.leetsoft.com "Typo") test
blog for him so he could work out the kinks… Well, he didn’t get it done
that night (it was a sunday night at like midnight) but they did fix it
sometime in the last 49 days (the last time i posted)… SO today I was
able to post to my blog using
[Writely](http://www.writely.com "Writely") , and I think that just
