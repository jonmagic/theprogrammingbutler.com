title: Learning Rails
---

Wow, what a couple of weeks(moths) it has been…\
\
My intro to [rails](http://www.rubyonrails.com "rails") began a few
months ago when a [good friend and webdev
guy](http://xian.mintchaos.com "good friend and webdev guy") told me he
was using it heavily and suggested i check it out… I have never had any
real programming experience and while the [rails intro
video](http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/RailsAcademy "rails intro video")
was cool I just couldn’t really get into it (scared i think). SO, i
stayed away for a little while, then came back and jumped on the band
wagon by adopting [Typo](http://typo.leetsoft.com/trac/wiki "Typo") , a
nice little blogging app with a lot of functionality, all built on
[rails](http://www.rubyonrails.com "rails")… this saved me from having
to learn how to program for a few more months and started to wet my
appetite to learn more.\
\
Then, about 4 weeks ago someone(who shall remain nameless) looked me up
and asked me to build a webapp… I could have shoved the project off on
Joshaven, but he is already crazy busy, so i decided to commit. No more
hiding in the shadows, no more chickening out because I don’t know how
to program, no more excuses… SO, I warned the client that I had no idea
what i was doing and asked if he was still willing to pay me, and he was
:-) so now I’m knee deep in this stuff and its only getting deeper…\
\
After throwing together a pretty much non-functional demo, and
convincing myself that i could do this, I decided I needed to read a
book on programming in ruby before i could really get comfortable in
rails. So i ran on down to [why’s poignant guide to
ruby](http://www.poignantguide.net/ruby/ "why's poignant guide to ruby")
and finished it in a weekend. Since then life has been a lot easier, at
least as far as programming goes.\
\
So I jumped back into the project, started from scratch, and built a
highly functional, even pretty, demo in 20 hours (two days)… The client
liked it and my friends and family even checked it out. That was Tuesday
of last week.\
\
Today is Sunday, although by the time I post this it will be Monday. I
spent 3 days trying to get RMagick installed on my computer, finally
succeeding late last night. Since then I’ve revamped version 1 of the
webapp to run faster, use better naming schemes, and have cleaner code
all around (thanx for the input [xian](http://xian.mintchaos.com "xian")
, i took your advice on combining controllers).\
\
And that is my learning [rails](http://www.rubyonrails.com "rails")
experience. Five slow months of avoiding the inevitable and then four
crazy [rubyonrails](http://www.rubyonrails.com "rubyonrails") filled
weeks.\
