title: clearcheckbook.com, a step in the right direction
---

I started using [clearcheckbook.com](http://clearcheckbook.com) about a
month ago and have found it an excellent way to keep track of my
spending and account balances. I’m still working on finding a web based
budgeting app, but in the meantime
[clearcheckbook.com](http://clearcheckbook.com) is serving me quite
well. They keep adding excellent features too, most notably (and
recently) the ability to access my account via IM, and my new favorite
feature, payment reminders (which are highly configurable)…

I’m hoping [pearbudget.com](http://pearbudget.com) gets their act
together soon and gives me a nice web20 app to do the budgeting part,
but in the meantime i’ll settle with my pencil and paper (sorry, just
not a big excel fan)…
