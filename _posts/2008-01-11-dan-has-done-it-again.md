title: Dan has done it again :-)
---

We are working towards integration between our web apps and quickbooks
at our office, and Dan has pushed ahead and made it work… Today he
released version [0.0.3 of his quickbooks
gem](http://quickbooks.rubyforge.org/) . Previously on rubyforge as
version 0.0.2, Dan took the previous authors work, completely rewrote
it, added in <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OLE</span></span> (I
believe) for connecting, instead of having to go thru Quickbooks other
<span class="caps"><span class="caps">API</span></span> designed for web
developers (because it is limited in what it can do), got in contact
with the prior author which let him post the new work under the same
name, and gave us 0.0.3…

So thank you [Dan](http://blog.behindlogic.com/) , keep up the good
work!
