title: I'm building a computer
---

I know, I know, thats not a big deal considering I’m part owner in a
computer store. But it IS a big deal to me, cuz this computer is going
to be my tech/gaming machine for my house. Here is the spec list:

-   [Asus <span class="caps">P5W DH</span>
    Deluxe](http://www.newegg.com/product/product.aspx?item=N82E16813131025)
-   Intel Core 2 Duo 2.2ghz with 2mb of L2 cache
-   2gb of <span class="caps">DDR2</span> 667mhz memory
-   80gb 7200rpm hdd
-   plain old black computer case
-   Lite-On 16x Dvd-burner
-   <span class="caps"><span class="caps">MOST</span> <span
    class="caps">IMPORTANT</span></span>: [Nvidia 9600GT video
    card](http://www.xpcgear.com/gig9600gt.html)
-   “Acer 19[<span class="caps">LCD</span>
    monitor](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824009091)
-   best keyboard i can find lying around
-   [Logitech MX-518 gaming
    mouse](http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=7105919&st=logitech+gaming&lp=4&type=product&cp=1&id=1109233585993)

I’ll also either be setting up some nice speakers, or get a nice little
usb headset for talking in my games :-) Fun fun…

Did I mention I’m stoked?
