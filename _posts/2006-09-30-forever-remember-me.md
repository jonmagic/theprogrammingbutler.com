So I’ve finished my first big programming project, [Forever Remember
Me](http://www.foreverrememberme.com) , a website catering to the
families and friends of those who have passed away… It is essentially a
place for these families to create a memorial, and upload pictures,
leave comments, and leave tributes (donations, which can go to a
charity)… So, make sure and check it out…
