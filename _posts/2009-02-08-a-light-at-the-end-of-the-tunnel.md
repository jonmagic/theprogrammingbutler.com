I know its not really spring yet, but I can’t help but get my hopes up.
Today around noon we reached 41 degrees, the sun was out, and it just
felt amazing outside.

To celebrate I cleaned out my car :-)

Then at 3pm we took the dogs for a walk, only Bailey’s second walk, his
first to the park. When we got home Natalie gave Bailey a bath in the
sink, while I gave Leo a bath in the tub (first time doing each of them
alone, quite a trick). Now I’m grilling outside, with sandals on!

I’m sure next week the temperature will be back down in the teens, but I
can’t help but get excited.
