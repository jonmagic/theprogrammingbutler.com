title: The Best Work Days
---

Today was an awesome day at work.

One of my favorite kind of work days is when we’re all working on
different things, we’re all in the zone, and we’re all in the same room.
Today was one of those days with Steve, John, and I all hacking on new
features for [our products](http://orderedlist.com/products/).

Every hour or two one of us would leave our keyboard and gather the
others to show what we’d got done and take input from the other two.
Then the others would take their turns in the spotlight.

For me at least this routine throughout the day kept me pumped up and
excited about my progress and pushed me to make even more headway.

I’m pretty psyched about what each of us are working on and I’m really
excited to show you soon!
