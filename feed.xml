                <p>I’ve been meaning to redo my site for quite some time now…
<a href="http://www.blosxom.com">blosxom</a> was great, but with time come changes.
So I’ve switched to using <a href="http://typo.leetsoft.com">Typo</a> for my
blogging engine… It was built using
<a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">RubyOnRails</a> , a new web development
framework that is pretty nifty…</p><p><strong>What does this mean for you?</strong> Not much really, a new look and feel…
My old site is still there with all the old content, just use the links
on the right to access it… I considered importing all my old posts to
the new system, but decided I don’t have enough time.</p><p><strong>What does this mean for me?</strong> Again, not much. Its going to be easier
to post now, and I can enhance my site using quite a bit more as I have
time… Any new feature I want I can implement, whether someone else has
done it or not… Hopefully this will get me excited about blogging again,
so you my poor reader(s) do not get bored :-)</p><p>Don’t forget to change your newsreaders to point at the new <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/jonmagic">xml
