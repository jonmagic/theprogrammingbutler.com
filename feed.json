Its going to be easier\nto post now, and I can enhance my site using quite a bit more as I have\ntime… Any new feature I want I can implement, whether someone else has\ndone it or not… Hopefully this will get me excited about blogging again,\nso you my poor reader(s) do not get bored :-)</p><p>Don’t forget to change your newsreaders to point at the new <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/jonmagic\">xml\nfeed</a> …</p>",
