<p>All righty then. Recently my firm (
<a href="http://www.sabretechllc.com">SabreTech</a> ) got a contract to write and
deploy a fairly complicated web app for a local business. Immediately I
asked my friend <a href="http://mintchaos.com">Xian</a> to give me some deployment
ideas, and he suggested I use <a href="http://nginx.net/">nginx</a> as my web
server instead of <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a> as well as
<a href="http://slicehost.com">Slicehost</a> as my vps host provider…</p>

<p>So I setup my slicehost account and starting hacking. about a week later
(five hours of work snuck in here and there), I’ve got my vps up and
running smoothly. I’ve been using
<a href="http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2006/3/6/switchtower-renamed">Capistrano</a>
for deployment for awhile, but I also wanted to use it to setup my
server, and that is when I ran across deprec.
<a href="http://deprec.rubyforge.org/">Deprec</a> is a nice little gem with a ton
of capistrano recipes for setting up and deploying a server. It had some
great recipes for deploying to <a href="http://ubuntu.org">Ubuntu</a> , so I chose
Ubuntu as my os for my new slice (vps).</p>

<p>Now I just had to write some of my own recipes for setting up and
deploying with Nginx instead of Apache. That is where most of my time
was spent. Below you’ll find my instructions and recipes:</p>

<h4 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h4>

<ol>
  <li>install the capistrano and deprec gems on your development machine</li>
  <li>cap your app, in the root of your app dir, run: cap -A</li>
  <li>setup deprec, from the root of your app run “deprec_dotfiles” which
just creates a file in your user dir called .caprc, which contains
the following line: require ‘deprec/recipes’</li>
  <li>your server must be running ubuntu (it should work on any debian
based os though)</li>
  <li>your svn repository must be accessible by the same user listed in
your deploy.rb</li>
  <li><a href="http://jonmagic.com/assets/2008/1/10/nginx.conf.txt">nginx.conf</a> ,
database.yml.production, and deploy.rb must exist and be configured
in app/config (and checked into your repository)</li>
  <li>and finally, you need to take <a href="http://jonmagic.com/assets/2008/1/10/jonmagic_recipes.txt">this
file</a> and
append the contents to the bottom of your config/deploy.rb (these
are the recipes i wrote)</li>
  <li>make sure and configure the mongrel settings in your deploy.rb</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="instructions">Instructions</h4>

<ol>
  <li>log into your server as root and add a new user (the user you
specify in your deploy.rb), set the password, and finally add to
sudoers file
    <ol>
      <li>useradd -m bobby</li>
      <li>passwd bobby</li>
      <li>visudo</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>from the root of your app run: cap
install_rails_stack_with_nginx</li>
  <li>the last one takes awhile, but when it is done run: cap
svn_cache_credentials</li>
  <li>finally run: cap deploy_first_time
    <ol>
      <li>(when it asks for mysql user password just press enter, unless
you changed the mysql root password)</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="files">Files</h4>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://jonmagic.com/assets/2008/1/10/nginx.conf.txt">nginx.conf</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://jonmagic.com/assets/2008/1/10/jonmagic_recipes.txt">my recipes, add to bottom of
deploy.rb</a></li>
</ul>
