    <p>Ok, I’ve setup quite a few mac’s for friends a clients, tweaking things
(even starting with a fresh install and only installing the necessary
components, without any extra bloat), installing useful utilities, and
arranging things to maximize workflow. I unfortunately have not recorded
this process to date and a good friend of mine needs to reinstall his os
and set everything up due to a harddrive crash, so I guess now is
finally the time to write down all the steps…</p>

<p>Step 1: When installing osx make sure to click on any buttons that say
options or customize. The first install screen that gives you one of
these will ask if you want to install over top, or wipe and reinstall. I
usually use the wipe option. The second screen that gives you one of
these two buttons, if you click it, will let you remove all the extra
programs you don’t need. I start by unchecking the box on printer
drivers, unchecking fonts, unchecking languages, and then I pick thru
the extras, usually removing stuff like garageband, etc. Once you’ve got
things tweaked, start the install (you can also skip the media check
that it runs)…</p>

<p>Step 2: Some techies say you should create an admin account and then a
locked down user account to run in on a daily basis. I find this a
nuisance, so I just create my one user on the initial install, make sure
I assign a password, and thats that. If you have security concerns, go
to your System Preferences, then to Accounts, click on Login Options,
and tell it not to auto login that user.</p>

<p>Step 3: Run all your system updates, click on the apple in the upper
left, then click Software Update.</p>

<p>Step 4: Create a Downloads folder in your home directory or on your
desktop, then open Safari and go to the Safari Preferences and set the
default download location to that folder. Otherwise downloads go to your
desktop and clutter things up real quick. This is a personal preference
of course, so do what you will. Also, remove unnecessary icons on your
dock and drag a shortcut to your home folder onto the dock (next to your
garbage can <span class="caps"><span class="caps">NOT</span> ON
IT</span>! and also a drag your applications folder onto your dock, next
to the home folder shortcut you just put there :-) On Mac’s shortcuts
are technically called Alias’, but whateva…</p>

<p>Step 5: Tweak Safari a little more by going to Safari Preferences and
unchecking the “Open Safe Files after downloading”. Also, I think in
older versions of Safari you had to enable Tabbed browsing.</p>

<p>Step 6: Disable Spotlight hot keys by clicking the Apple in the upper
left, then click on System Preferences, then go to Spotlight, and on the
first tab uncheck both the boxes at the bottom. You will need to do this
so you can map <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CMD</span></span>-Space as Quicksilver’s hot key later.</p>

<p>Step 7: Download your useful utilities and programs… Fire up Safari and
start with these great programs:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.net">Quicksilver</a> is an amazing file
launcher/object manipulation tool, super duper easy.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.mozilla.com">Firefox</a> is an alternate web browser that
many people like.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.caminobrowser.org/">Camino</a> is my preferred web browser
for business type stuff.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.titanium.free.fr/pgs/english.html">OnyX</a> is a great
program for tweaking stuff in osx, including dock position, etc.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.adiumx.com">Adium</a> is an excellent multi protocol chat
program, it really covers all the bases.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.skype.com">Skype</a> is great for voice and video chat, I
use this with my fam and friends.</li>
  <li><a href="http://joost.com">Joost</a> is still invite only, but you can sign up
to get on the beta list. Joost is an online television set
type thingy.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.newsgator.com/download/products/NetNewsWireLite2.1.1.dmg.zip">NetNewsWire
Lite</a>
is an excellent news reader application! Make sure and subscribe to
<a href="http://jonmagic.com/feed/atom.xml">my feed</a> once you install it :-)</li>
</ul>

<p>I was thinking I used a lot more programs, but with web based
applications really starting to be just as functional as desktop apps, I
don’t use nearly as many desktop apps as I used to. Here are some web
apps I use all the time:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://gmail.com">Gmail</a> is a free email solution, by far the best
in my opinion.</li>
  <li><a href="http://docs.google.com">Google Docs and Spreadsheets</a> has
completely replaced Microsoft Office for my needs.</li>
  <li><a href="http://calendar.google.com">Google Calendar</a> is a flexible calendar
with great sharing capabilities, I also use
<a href="http://chip.cuccio.us/projects/gcal/">Gcal</a> as a standalone desktop
interface to Gcal.</li>
  <li><a href="http://del.icio.us">Del.icio.us</a> handles all my bookmarks, I make
sure and go to their help section and drag both the “post to
del.icio.us” and “my del.icio.us” bookmarklets onto my bookmarks bar
in all my browsers. In Safari, if you make them the first to
bookmarks on your bookmarks bar, you can access them with <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CMD</span></span>-1 and <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CMD</span></span>-2.</li>
  <li><a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a> is where I store all my digital photos
online, I guess I mostly just use iPhoto on my laptop though, and
then upload to flickr for backup.</li>
  <li>I have reluctantly started using <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>
to keep in contact with people, and their Picture section is also
really handy for getting photos to friends and family.</li>
</ul>

<p>Step 8: Go to the folder you downloaded all these great programs to and
start double clicking those installer icons :-) Some you will expand to
a new folder, and then you can drag the app over to your Applications
folder on your dock (if you followed step 4). Other installers will
actually run a full fledged install app that will copy things to the
appropriate places automatically.</p>

<p>Step 9: Go to your Applications folder and look for Quicksilver, which
you copied there in the previous step… Double click it and follow the
setup instructions. I always re-assign my hotkey to <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CMD</span></span>-Space for ease of use.
Once Quicksilver is loaded, press <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CMD</span></span>-Space to open it, then press <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CMD</span></span>-, to open Quicksilver
Preferences. I set mine to start at login, and sometimes tweak some
other settings.</p>

<p>Step 10: I like to open up OnyX and set my dock to the right hand side
and so that it aligns to the bottom, thats just me though.</p>

<p>This is a good start, I’ll add to it as I think of more things :-)</p>
