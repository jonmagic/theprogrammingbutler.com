    <p>I was contracted to build a fairly simple phototherapy treatment time
calculator app for one of our clients recently, and in the process
learned A LOT about developing for the iPhone and Android using
html/css/javascript.</p>

<p>The requirements for the job were that the final app feel native and
that it be able to be purchased on the respective market place (Appstore
or Android Market).</p>

<p>I’d already written the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/daavlin-phototherapy-dose/id386168638?mt=8">app once for the
iPhone</a>,
using the <a href="http://www.jqtouch.com/">jqTouch</a> library and then wrapping
the whole thing with <a href="http://www.phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a>, but this time
around the client wanted to add some features that made me look further
than jqTouch.</p>

<p>Initially I fantasized about a write once deploy twice approach using
something like <a href="http://www.appcelerator.com/products/titanium-mobile-application-development/">Appcelerator
Titanium</a>.
The more I read however the more I realized no matter how I went about
this project I was going to end up with more than one codebase, one for
the iPhone and at least one for the Android. I decided to go ahead with
Appcelerator however and developed for the iPhone first. One of the
biggest things I was looking for was a native bottom tab bar for
navigating between the different phototherapy calculators (<span class="caps">UVB</span>, <span class="caps">UVA</span>, UVA1, and Blue),
and Appcelerator let me quickly build a native, beautiful, functional
app that exactly fit the clients needs.</p>

<p>After a bit of troubleshooting I had it deploying to my actual iPhone,
but no matter how hard I tried I could never manage to get it to deploy
to the Android emulator.</p>

<p>Next I started working on a <a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/">Sencha
Touch</a> version of the app, which
I planned to wrap with PhoneGap, but after about an hour of digging
around in Sencha I decided it didn’t fit my programming aesthetic. I
also talked to someone who wrote an app in Sencha and they said it had a
ways to go with speed, animations were still jerky on older hardware.</p>

<p>Finally I decided to give <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/">JqueryMobile</a> a try
(thanx Xian!) and it was a great fit for a webdev like me. Using the
latest PhoneGap and JqueryMobile I had the app rewritten and running on
the Android Emulator in just under 2 hours, and then another 2 hours
tweaking the interface and interactions. If you know
html/css/javascript, you can write a fairly native feeling app in no
time with JqueryMobile.</p>

<p>Having used jqTouch, Appcelerator, JqueryMobile, PhoneGap, and having
looked at Sencha, I have to say Appcelerator was by far the best
experience. I enjoyed programming the interface rather than laying out
the html and then styling it with <span class="caps">CSS</span>. I
enjoyed how quickly and easy it was to deploy to the iPhone (I wish it
could do the same for Android!). Most of all I loved how it built a
native interface, which beats an html5 interface almost every time in my
opinion.</p>
