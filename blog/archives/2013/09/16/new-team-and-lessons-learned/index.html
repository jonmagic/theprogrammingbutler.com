    <p>The past few months I have been building a new team at
<a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> focused on solving problems for our
business teams. Here are a few valuable lessons we learned along the
way.</p>

<h3 id="solving-the-right-problem">Solving the right problem</h3>

<p>We solve problems for a living and we have one major constraint, our
time. This means we need to be thoughtful in choosing which problems to
solve. We cannot solve them all.</p>

<p>We decided to solve employee expenses at GitHub by building our own
expensing system. We had evaluated <a href="http://expensify.com">3rd party
services</a> and while they did 90% of what we
needed, that last 10% made it seem like it was worth doing on our own.</p>

<p>What we failed to account for were the other opportunities, the other
problems that needed solved, that ultimately would have a more lasting
impact on GitHub.</p>

<p>If we use our company vision, to help people <a href="https://github.com/home">build software better
together</a>, as a framework for deciding what to
work on, choosing the right problem to solve becomes much easier.</p>

<p>We should be sensitive to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost">opportunity
costs</a>. Solve the problem
that will have the greatest impact with the lowest cost.</p>

<h3 id="failing-fast">Failing fast</h3>

<p>After choosing the wrong problem to solve we did not set clear goals so
that we knew what success or failure meant. As a result it took us four
months to realize we were working on the wrong thing.</p>

<p>Our first goal was to ship a system that received receipts, connected
them to transactions, provided automatic and manual classification, and
then entered the data into our accounting system.</p>

<p>The more I learn about software development, or solving any problem
really, the more I realize a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winning_percentage">winning
percentage</a> requires
breaking down problems (and their solutions) into smaller and smaller
pieces. Shipping quickly and constant iteration mean faster course
corrections and less costly failures.</p>

<p>The fact that we could not easily break the expensing problem down into
smaller pieces should have been a red flag.</p>

<p>We can reduce the costs of failure, both emotionally and economically,
if we fail fast. We canâ€™t fail fast unless we ship quickly and iterate.</p>

<h3 id="do-the-simplest-thing-first">Do the simplest thing first</h3>

<p>We also started building a platform for different teams (and apps) at
GitHub to be able to easily invoice customers. We dreamt up the perfect
platform for invoicing, without having tried the simplest thing first.</p>

<p>The lie we often believe is that we understand what our constraints will
be in a week, or a month, or six months and therefore we can save time
by optimizing early. The truth is that we cannot foresee the future.</p>

<p>In the end we learned that invoicing integration needed to be built
inside of the products it serves first. After it has been proven it can
possibly be extracted into a shared service. This sounds like more work
in the long run, but ultimately this process can adapt to change more
quickly and easily.</p>

<h3 id="one-more-thing">One more thing</h3>

<p>We could have avoided a lot of heartache and wasted resources if I had
sought mentorship from people with more experience and context at
GitHub.</p>

<p>For long term success I need to constantly be learning, which means
keeping an open mind and a humble spirit. I look forward to the journey
