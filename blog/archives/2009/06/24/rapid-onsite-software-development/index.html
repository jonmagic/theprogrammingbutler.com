    <p>My uncle has been bugging me to help him with writing some software for
awhile now, and this last weekend he sent me another email with a new
idea, to help him in his business. I had some time available this week,
so I decided to drive down to his shop and try something. My goal was to
take his simple idea, boil it down to its essence, and write the whole
application in a day using <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">Rails</a>.</p>

<p>To prepare myself I started working on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">TDD</span></span></a>
again, using <a href="http://thoughtbot.com/projects/shoulda/">shoulda</a> and
<a href="http://thoughtbot.com/projects/factory_girl">factory_girl</a>. I also
built my own version of
<a href="http://github.com/fudgestudios/bort/tree/master">bort</a> from the ground
up, called <a href="http://github.com/jonmagic/pudding/">pudding</a> (it has a
couple flavors, including
<a href="http://github.com/jonmagic/pudding/tree/vanilla">vanilla</a> and
<a href="http://github.com/jonmagic/pudding/tree/tapioca">tapioca</a>). I tried to
find the right mix of features to give myself a running start when I
arrived onsite.</p>

<p>I arrived at 8:30am this morning and started programming at 9am. At
first things were going fairly well, building my models out using <span class="caps"><span class="caps">TDD</span></span> went fast, and I was
rolling along nicely on writing my controllers using <span class="caps"><span class="caps">TDD</span></span> when I hit a wall,
aka, lack of knowledge on my part. After hitting this wall for 45
minutes I finally gave up on <span class="caps"><span class="caps">TDD</span></span> and just went back to my old way of doing
things, i.e. no testing.</p>

<p>I was back on a roll again, using my <a href="https://github.com/jonmagic/webapp_gui/tree">osx
theme</a> for the admin
interface, and <a href="http://www.blueprintcss.org/">blueprint</a> for the css
reset, typography, and layout on the technician facing part of the
application (the part that will be used the most).</p>

<p>Things were going along nicely until I ran into issues with the way I
was doing ajax modals, via <a href="http://jquery.com/demo/thickbox/">thickbox</a>.
I’d already implemented quite a bit using thickbox, when I decided I
needed to start over on my modals using a different library. So far I
think I’m gonna use <a href="http://dev.iceburg.net/jquery/jqModal/">jqModal</a>.</p>

<p>So, at 4:30pm I called it quits for the day, realizing my “app in a day”
dream was not gonna happen, although I believe I’m about a 1/3rd of the
way there, which isn’t too bad.</p>

<h3 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>I need to work quite a bit more on testing, I need to know it like
the back of my hand</li>
  <li>I need to have a sample controller built out in my pudding apps, so
I can do a bit of copy/paste when building my controllers</li>
  <li>It would also be nice to include my osx theme, and blueprint theme
in my pudding apps</li>
  <li>I need to get better at jQuery, and find the best plugins for my
different needs</li>
</ul>
